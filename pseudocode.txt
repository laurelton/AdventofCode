####	Part 1
checksum = 0
for each line
    checksum += (max - min)

####	Part 2
checksum = 0
for each line
	for each number
		for each index greater than the current
			compare current_number and later_index
			dividend = bigger number
			divisor = smaller number
			if remainder == 0 then add quotient to checksum
